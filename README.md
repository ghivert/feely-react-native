# Feely React Native

Feely is a project to deeply compare React Native and Flutter. Because we are always wondering what is the best between two frameworks and languages, I decided to take time to test the two frameworks. I already did a project with React Native, while I did not achieved anything with Flutter. Of course, we can expect things to be simpler in React Native on some points (probably because of the ecosystem), and harder on others (no Skia or Native code compiling). The goal is to point all those strong and weak points, on one side or the other. You can find the project Flutter twin [here, on my other `feely-flutter` project](https://github.com/ghivert/feely-flutter).

Take any of this as an experiment. Maybe this experiment will go so long that I’ll be able to share code between web and React Native. In any case, you can expect a review once the project will be achieved.

# Why TypeScript?

Because React Native deserves the best. Because Dart is type-checked. All candidates must fight with the same power.

# Why not Expo?

It is a very good question. I do not want to use Expo at all. Because Expo helps to start an application, it is a very good starting point when learning React Native, or when you need to hurry. The idea behind Feely is to take time to do things right. And it means to bypass Expo right now. I need to test things extensively on their own, without any abstraction layer. React Native is a strong abstraction layer by itself.

Of course it has to be MIT. What else could it be?
